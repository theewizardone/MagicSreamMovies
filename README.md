## About  

This project is a full-stack simulation of a modern **Movie Streaming Platform**, designed to showcase how different technologies can be combined to deliver a scalable, AI-powered application.  

The system brings together a **React-based frontend** for an engaging user experience, a **Go-based backend** for high-performance API services that runs on the gin (gin-gonic) web framework, and an **AI-powered recommendation engine** to personalize movie suggestions using **LangChainGo** and **OpenAI**.  

It also demonstrates how **MongoDB** can serve as a reliable, scalable database solution for managing media metadata and user preferences.
